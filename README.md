emayili is a package for sending emails from R. The design goals are:

  - works on all manner of SMTP servers and
  - has minimal dependencies (or dependencies which are easily
    satisfied).

The package name is an adaption of the Zulu word for email, imeyili.

## Installation

Get the stable version from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=emayili).

``` r
install.packages("emayili")
```

Or grab it directly from
[GitHub](https://github.com/datawookie/emayili).

``` r
# Install from the master branch.
remotes::install_github("datawookie/emayili")
# Install from the development branch.
remotes::install_github("datawookie/emayili", ref = "dev")
```

## Usage

First create a message object.

``` r
library(emayili)
library(magrittr)

email <- envelope()
```

The message has class `envelope`.

``` r
class(email)
```

    [1] "envelope"

Add addresses for the sender and recipient.

``` r
email <- email %>%
  from("alice@yahoo.com") %>%
  to("bob@google.com") %>%
  cc("craig@google.com")
```

There are also `bcc()` and `reply()` functions for setting the `Bcc` and
`Reply-To` fields.

Add a subject.

``` r
email <- email %>% subject("This is a plain text message!")
```

Add a text body. You can use `html()` to add an HTML body.

``` r
email <- email %>% text("Hello!")
```

Add an attachment.

``` r
email <- email %>% attachment("image.jpg")
```

Create a SMTP server object and send the message.

``` r
smtp <- server(host = "smtp.gmail.com",
               port = 465,
               username = "bob@gmail.com",
               password = "bd40ef6d4a9413de9c1318a65cbae5d7")
smtp(email, verbose = TRUE)
```

Simply printing a message displays the header information.

``` r
email
```

    Date:         Wed, 03 Jun 2020 14:04:34 GMT
    From:         alice@yahoo.com
    To:           bob@google.com
    Cc:           craig@google.com
    Subject:      This is a plain text message!
    X-Mailer:     {emayili}-0.3.13

You can identify emails which have been sent using `{emayili}` by the
presence of an `X-Mailer` header which includes both the package name
and version.

To see the guts of the message as passed to the SMTP server:

``` r
print(email, details = TRUE)
```

### Using STARTTLS

If youâ€™re trying to send email with a host that uses the STARTTLS
security protocol (like Google Mail, Yahoo\! or AOL), then it will most
probably be blocked due to insufficient security. In order to circumvent
this, you can grant access to less secure apps. See the links below for
specifics:

  - [Google](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
    ([details](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255))
  - [Yahoo\!](https://login.yahoo.com/account/security) and
  - [AOL](https://login.aol.com/account/security).
