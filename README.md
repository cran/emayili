emayili is a package for sending emails from R. The design goals are:

  - works on all manner of SMTP servers and
  - has minimal dependencies (or dependencies which are easily
    satisfied).

The package name is an adaption of the Zulu word for email, imeyili.

## Installation

Simply install from GitHub.

``` r
remotes::install_github("datawookie/emayili")
```

## Usage

First create a message object.

``` r
library(emayili)
library(magrittr)

email <- envelope()
```

Add addresses for the sender and recipient.

``` r
email <- email %>%
  from("alice@yahoo.com") %>%
  to("bob@google.com") %>%
  cc("craig@google.com")
```

There are also `bcc()` and `reply()` functions for setting the `Bcc` and
`Reply-To` fields.

Add a subject.

``` r
email <- email %>% subject("This is a plain text message!")
```

Add a text body. You can use `html()` to add an HTML body.

``` r
email <- email %>% text("Hello!")
```

Add an attachment.

``` r
email <- email %>% attachment("image.jpg")
```

Create a SMTP server object and send the message.

``` r
smtp <- server(host = "smtp.gmail.com",
               port = 465,
               username = "bob@gmail.com",
               password = "bd40ef6d4a9413de9c1318a65cbae5d7")
smtp(email, verbose = TRUE)
```

You can identify emails which have been sent using `{emayili}` by the
presence of an `X-Mailer` header which includes both the package name
and version.

### Using STARTTLS

If youâ€™re trying to send email with a host that uses the STARTTLS
security protocol (like Google Mail, Yahoo\! or AOL), then it will most
probably be blocked due to insufficient security. In order to circumvent
this, you can grant access to less secure apps. See the links below for
specifics:

  - [Google](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
    ([details](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255))
  - [Yahoo\!](https://login.yahoo.com/account/security) and
  - [AOL](https://login.aol.com/account/security).

## Debugging

To see the guts of the message as passed to the SMTP server, do the
following:

    cat(emayili:::message(email))
